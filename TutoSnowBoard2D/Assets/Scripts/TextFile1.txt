TODO LIST :

VIEW IN THIS PROJECT : 
- (Create gameObject) Sprite Shape Closed : for 2D plateformer
	- fill material = center sprite (BG) 
	- Edge Material = border sprite (Ground)
	
	-> Top and down mayb be set with the selected Profile (Idealy create personal one)

- (Component) Edge / Surface Collider 2D: 
	-> Allow to create collider with adaptive shape (can be set with the "offset" field) 

- (Design Tech) Delimitation of assets border (for repeating painting for exemple)
	=> Clic Asset File -> Sprite Editor -> Move Green Lines for new limitation
	=> Wrap mode : Repeat (set from delimited border)

- (Extension) Cinemachine : Allow Multiple Camera Handle + Easy follow one mono target 
	-> Cool Feature Trigger zoom for run / dezoom for walk dedezoom(normal size) when stopped 
	-> Cinematic Triggered Camera / Scene / Zoom on NPC or point of interest

- (GameObject) Caracter : One Gameobject with a rigidBody who regroup differents 
						  gameobject (body parts), Parent GO(GameObject) Contain 
						  a Definied Center in with other Child Compenents may gravit (
						  Carefull with Transform position(better reset child to parent) try to
						  center child with parent)						  

- (Component) Surface Effector : Allow Physic Force in Triggered Contact with other collider 

- (Component RigidBody) Collision Detection : Continuous more expensive but more accuracte (avoir passing over ground)					

- (Script) Rigidbody2D.AddTorque(Xf): allow to exherce force to the GO (avoid directict rotate on object)
										to be handle with RigidBody Settings aswell
										: Linear Drag - how much friction when moving backward / forward
											+ In addition to surface effector  : speed : X;
										: Angular Drag - how much friction when spin around

- (NameSpace) using UnityEngine.SceneManagement : special unity namespace allowing specials methods like LoadScene (go to index scene)

- (File - Build Setting) Scene Manager Allowing Indexing for unity engin and methods like 
							SceneManager.LoadScene(0); 0 = First index of build setting scenes 

- (Method) Using Invoke("methodName", delay); -> pass in a method name to call it after a specified delay

- (Method) (old?) Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftArrow) Retrieve User Input

-(Component) Audio Source - Can Access multiple AudioClip by letting the component field empty	
							and set which SFX to play by script (onTrigger GetComponent<AudioSource>().PlayOneShot(crashSFX))

							- (Methodes) Acces Public Methods : FindObjectOfType<PlayerControls>().DisableControls();
